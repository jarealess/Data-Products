## **EDA For the CAR dataset**  

In this notebook I'm going to explore the *car* dataset in order to understand its characteristics before deploying a shiny app using this data.  

```{r}
## summary
data("cars")
summary(cars)
```  
There are two variables. Let's plot them.  

```{r}
##plot
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```  
We can fit a linear model to this data and see its performance.  

```{r}
## fitting model
modelFit <- lm(dist~speed, data=cars)
summary(modelFit)
```  
Now let's see the residuals plot and the fitted plot.  

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

## plot1
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
abline(modelFit, lwd=2, col="blue", lty=2)

## plot2
plot(modelFit,6)
```
